# Unity-VersionTool

This editor allows Unity developers to set the version of an application for all platforms at once.

## Usage
Once the package has been imported, a new menu entry `Window > Version Settings` is available.
It opens a window where the version number can be selected.

There are two options to set the version:
1. Enter the major, minor and patch numbers, as well as the production status, with the text fields and dropdown menu.
To apply the version number, click the button "Save Version".
The currently saved version number is displayed in the window.

2. The major, minor and patch version can also be incremented quickly by pressing the corresponding button on the menu.

The build number is not editable since it is automatically increased each time the project is compiled.
